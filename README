Bootsplash
==========

This the Bootsplash package for Mageia.

The images are stored in initrd and loaded by the kernel at the initrd
loading.

You can configure some stuff via /etc/sysconfig/bootsplash
the option are :

# Specify here if you want add the splash logo to initrd when
# generating an initrd. You can specify :
#
# SPLASH=no to don't have a splash screen
#
# SPLASH=auto to make autodetect the splash screen
# 
# SPLASH=INT When Integer could be 800x600 1024x768 1280x1024
#
SPLASH=auto

# Choose the themes. The should be based in 
# /usr/share/bootsplash/themes/
THEME=Mageia-Default

# Say yes here if you want to leave the logo on the console.
# Three options :
#
# LOGO_CONSOLE=no don't display logo under console.
#
# LOGO_CONSOLE=yes display logo under console.
#
# LOGO_CONSOLE=theme leave the theme to decide.
#
LOGO_CONSOLE=theme

The config how the text are aligned is in the cfg files of the theme.

You can switch theme by using the command :

/usr/share/bootsplash/scripts/switch-themes THEME_NAME

To create a theme simply copy one default theme change the .jpg of
images/ directory adjust the .cfg files and generate a lilo image with
the bmp2mdk script of the lilo package (ask: fpons@mandrakesoft.com)
for more information about this).

Some stuff here has been inspired from what SuSe does (kudos to Suse).

LILO boot images
================

Lilo boot image are generated with the bmp2mdk script that can be found
in lilo package.

The command to generate the message file looks like:

./bmp2mdk mode:0x101 timer:63+280,80+358,64+83,64+119 entry:63+144,80+70,64+84,64+119,9,42 clear:480,640,64+119 pos:63,80 progress:0x15e,0x97,0xa,0xe < installboot82-eus.bmp > boot.msg

or

./bmp2mdk mode:0x101 clear:480,640,64+119 pos:63,80 progress:0x15e,0x97,0x0a,0x0e,64+59 < installboot82-eus.bmp > boot.msg

the +119 value must be adapted to the given color palette for the picture used.
